## 💬 Online VS Offline studying
Here is what I think about each of the studying options:

| Online | Offline |
| :--- | :--- |
| You can sleep more; no need to commute | You can hang out with your pals |
| Flexible schedule; lecture recordings | Direct interaction with professors |

## 🖋️ My favourite math formulas
Here are some of my favourite math formulas: 

,- this is the parabolic function formula;
$$y = \alpha x^{2} + \beta x + \gamma$$

,- this is the modified hyperbolic function;
$$y = \frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}x + c}$$

,- this is how to solve quadratic equation.
$$D = b^{2} - 4ac, x_{1} = \frac{-b + \sqrt{D}}{2a}, x_{2} = \frac{-b - \sqrt{D}}{2a}$$

,- this is the formula for calculating the area of a circle.
$$A = \pi r^{2}$$

## 🧑‍💻 My coding skills
I am skilled enough to do some coding - here is one of the examples: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, GitHub!";
    return 0;
}
```
